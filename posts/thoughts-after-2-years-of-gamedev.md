Hey! I'm Julian, a solo game developer. Two years ago I decided to go back to game development on my free time and build a community around it. I created this website, made videos and streamed on Twitch while learning how to make 3D voxel art games. Since one year I'm making Saya, a game featuring voxel graphics where you play a samurai summoned to rid the worlds of darkness.

1. Quick intro about the current project, what I'm doing
2. Finding your own style and workflow
    2.b Take the time to fail
    2.a How I found my own style with voxel art
    2.c Create early builds (why => a step towards quality builds, pipeline to automate, try on different systems, demos, alpha, ... does it work?)
3. Think big then cut the fat
    3.a You shouldn't restrain yourself (ideas, let the flow, go to try, go gamedev => you should be passionate about )
    3.b The compound effect (you will have a shit ton of dead projects, but also a shit ton of experience, systems, ...)
    3.c The summer body of your next project
4. Making games is not always fun
    4.a You can't go fulltime
    4.b You have to keep going
    4.c A sleep debt "this big"
5. Pursue your dreams, go make games

## Find your own style and workflow

If you work on a project with a small team or you are a solo game developer, you certainly noticed the complexity of wearing multiple hats. While it's exciting to sharpen your skills on so many different scopes (game design, programming, art, ...), it's also challenging to keep your head above the water. You need to create your own systems so you can be efficient from one day to the next and from one project to the next.

### Run small experimentations

Game developers are like mad scientists creating worlds with their own rules. We apply math, code, art and crazyness to bring monstrosities and wonders to life. By running small experimentations you can learn quickly and make better
decisions for your game without the overhead of integrating everything in the final scene or level.

Now you might wonder when you should do these experimentations? For which kind of game? Well, I would say always, you
just need to adapt depending on the context:

- A gamejam is an experimentation by itself, if the event is short like 72h or less you will get a prototype. If it's
during a week then you can exctract some core gameplay mechanics in their own scene to experiment first. But integrate
the different parts as soon as possible so you can balance your game and you avoid last minute surprises.

- An open world, for example, could be divided in regions. You can also make a test scene for each game mechanic before trying to integrate everything together and see if it fits the big picture. Then you can apply the same technique for
your levels, algorithms, levels, etc. That's also how bigger teams work, everything is isolated first and should work by
its own before being integrated and tested with the rest.

I like this approach because it helps to focus on a specific piece of the game without worrying about the rest or being
distracted because of the external events. It reduces the feedback loop and help to organize your project. It's also a
great way to reuse code or assets across projects because you removed the dependencies.

### Pick the right scope for you

According to the general consensus, it's better to reduce your scope at maximum to learn and fail fast. I agree with this statement except in these two cases:

- You don't have prior experience, you just start game development in which case you shouldn't restrain your motivation.
Go for your big dream project, and fail. Expel that need to create your big dream project, you will realize your limits
soon enough. However you will **learn**. Everything you do in this first attempt will serve you for the rest of your
gamedev path.

- You explicitly took the decision of doing the impossible. Sometimes you can't help yourself and it's your only fuel
for motivation. And it's ok. Just make sure that everything is designed in a way that you can reuse it in the next
projects (even for improvement). Because you know you will certainly add this project to the pile of the unfinished ones. Again, you will learn and you will start to invest for future projects. But be ready.

If there is one thing I learned about game development is that you shouldn't wait to have the perfect game design, idea
or scope to start. Especially if it's the first time you create a video game. Don't think about it too much and allow
you to think big even if you will fail. There is nothing wrong in not achieving a game, because the most important is
that you practiced and gained experience that you can reuse later for your next game.

I recommend to make a light game design document, or take notes somewhere so you can have a general frame. Then you can go back and forth to your game design document when you validate or reject some ideas. Try to keep it small and efficient. This document should help you or anyone to keep track of the scope and at the minimum the core features of your game.

### Be ready to throw away

Just like with any experimentation you need to analyse the outcome and take a decision. You keep it or you throw it
away. [todo]
