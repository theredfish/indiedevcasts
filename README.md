Please visit [indiedevcasts.com](https://indiedevcasts.com).

## What's your stack?

- NextJS 13 (experimental app dir is `on`)
- TailwindCSS
- Vercel hosting

## Why is it open source?

- Free hosting with Vercel
- Help people to build similar NextJS apps
  - Please note that I'm coding as fast as possible due to the limited time on this project. It's not the best architecture you can find. Many shortcuts are taken, plus I push my experimentations here.
- Allow readers to correct typos, dead links, accessibility, or add additional information where appropriate, etc. I will be happy to receive any PR helping to improve the website content.
