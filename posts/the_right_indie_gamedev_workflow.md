Hey! I'm Julian, an indie game developer. Two years ago I decided to go back to game development in my free time and build a community around it. I created this website, made videos and streamed on Twitch while learning how to make 3D voxel art games. For the past year, I've been making Saya, a game featuring voxel graphics where you play as a samurai summoned to rid the worlds of darkness.

## Find your own style and workflow

If you work on a project with a small team or you are a solo game developer, you certainly noticed the complexity of wearing multiple hats. While it's exciting to sharpen your skills on so many different scopes (game design, programming, art, ...), it's also challenging to keep your head above the water. You need to create your own systems so you can be efficient from one day to the next and from one project to the next.

### Run small experimentations

Game developers are like mad scientists creating worlds with their own rules. We apply math, code, art and craziness to bring monstrosities and wonders to life. By running small experiments, you can learn quickly and make better decisions
for your game without the overhead of integrating everything into the final scene or level.
Now you might wonder when you should do these experimentations? For which kind of game? Well, I would say always, you
just need to adapt depending on the context:

- A game jam is an experiment in itself. If the event is short, like 72 hours or less, you'll end up with a prototype in
a very short time. If it's during a week then you can extract some core gameplay mechanics in their own scene to experiment first. But integrate the different parts as soon as possible so you can balance your game and you avoid last minute surprises.

- An open world, for example, could be divided in regions. You can also make a test scene for each game mechanic before trying to integrate everything together and see if it fits the big picture. Then you can apply the same technique for
your levels, algorithms, levels, etc. That's also how bigger teams work, everything is isolated first and should work by
its own before being integrated and tested with the rest.

I like this approach because it helps to focus on a specific piece of the game without worrying about the rest or being
distracted because of the external events. It reduces the feedback loop and helps to organize your project. It's also a
great way to reuse code or assets across projects because you removed the dependencies.

### Pick the right scope for you

According to the general consensus, it's better to reduce your scope at maximum to learn and fail fast. I agree with this statement except in these two cases:

- You don't have prior experience, you just start game development in which case you shouldn't restrain your motivation.
Go for your big dream project, and fail. Expel that need to create your dream project, you will realize your limits
soon enough. However you will **learn**. Everything you do in this first attempt will serve you for the rest of your
gamedev path.

- You explicitly took the decision of doing the impossible. Sometimes you can't help yourself and it's your only fuel
for motivation. And it's ok. Just make sure that everything is designed in a way that you can reuse it in the next
projects (even for improvement). "Because you know you'll likely add this project to the pile of unfinished ones.
Again, you will learn and you will start to invest for future projects. But be ready.

If there is one thing I learned about game development is that you shouldn't wait to have the perfect game design, idea
or scope to start. Especially if it's the first time you create a video game. Don't think about it too much and allow
yourself to think big even if you will fail. There is nothing wrong in not achieving a game, because the most important is that you practiced and gained experience that you can reuse later for your next game.

I recommend to make a light game design document, or take notes somewhere so you can have a general frame. Then you can go back and forth to your game design document when you validate or reject some ideas. Try to keep it small and efficient. This document should help you or anyone to keep track of the scope and at the minimum the core features of your game.

### The summer body of your next project

Just like with any experiment, you need to analyze the outcome and make a decision. Was your scope too big? Or maybe you
lost motivation for this particular project? You might also realize you wanted to try a specific game mechanic
or art direction but you still don't know what should be the game. It's all right, you just need to take a step back,
assess and accept it could be time to stop.

I know, it's hard. Because you love your project, you spent a lot of time on it, to pitch it or share it on social media
and now you have to throw it away? How dare you? Yeah... but you know it's not lost knowledge or experience. Did you
build a community, even a small one? Did you learn something? Did you achieve something you were proud of? Did you have
this rush of dopamine with this specific part of the game you created?

Good! Now keep this project somewhere, version it with git and put it on GitLab or GitHub if it's not already the case.
It's time for a new project, but you will anticipate more things now:

- What are your limits? Take the time to list them and how to overcome them. Be reasonable.
- What worked or didn't? Learn from your failures just as your successes.
- Did you find your own style and workflow? Or is it something you should explore a bit more?
- Was your scope too important? List all the elements you think were too much for you. Be honest.

This is what I call the summer body of your next project! Now I want to share with you what I learned, and maybe you can pick some ideas for your games!

## Zero to gamedev

I want to go through my game development experience over the last years and share with you what I learned. While I
consider I'm really doing game development since 2 years, note that I had a few experiences before that gave me a taste
of video game development.

### My first game development experience

Back in 2014, when I was a computer science student at university, a bunch of cool geeks and I decided to participate in our first game jam. We thought it would be a good way to put our feet in this industry and strengthen our programming skills.

We participated in the "Utopiales Game Jam". It was a bit intimidating. I particularly remember that some folks from
Alkemi, a French indie game studio, were participating in this game jam. But still, I went completely unprepared. I
only learned how to use Unity through the space shooter tutorial 3 days before. Why Unity? Because it was very popular,
free and appreciated from indie developers. So the chances to find people who use this game engine in game jams were
quite high — My guess was correct, almost everybody was using it. If I had to choose today, I think it would mainly be
Godot and Unity. Both are popular amongst indies.

It's been my most important game development experience. I didn't sleep much but I learned a lot and it was just a lot
of fun. We formed a team of 10! And I learned about all these other roles necessary to make a game: sound designers, graphic designers, motion designers, game designers, ...

The game jam theme was "Brain" and we had 48 hours to find a game idea, make it, publish it and the best part: few days
later people from the "Utopiales" event would be able to play it! It was a crazy and intense first experience where we
made a puzzle game to connect neurons between them to solve each level! I even got some help from the Alkemi's creative director to implement a core game mechanic. I remember how happy I was to get some help from someone who is experienced in making and publishing games. Not only it helped us a lot (certainly saved us several hours), but also it felt just great to share this short moment with a game developer.

Then I participated in more game jams (always physical), some went well, others were a bit more difficult. You don't always find the right roles or the right scope for your game. But no matter the game jam I always learned something — especially how to work with a team.

In conclusion, add game jams in your learning process! Even if you are actively developing your own game it will help you to learn new things, meet people and take a break from your game. You can go solo or with a team, as you prefer.

### Failures after failures

Okay, game jams are fun and all, but I never reached a point where we decided to pursue a game long enough to make a commercial release. So what do you do? You make your own game. Do you have a team? No. But that's ok because you're
ready to wear several hats, handle everything by yourself and in 3 to 6 months publish your game on Steam. Nein!

At this point you just realize that you need to learn all the things that aren't your main skills. For me it was:

- 3D Modeling
- Character design
- Rigging, animating
- A bit of physics
- Shaders
- Marketing, communication, ...

And most of all you need to be resilient! Life will not bend to your gamedev schedule. Also you will lose motivation and
interest in your game. You will also hate your game. I'm now at my 4th attempt of making a game that I can publish and
not necessarily a commercial game. I tried to make a weird 3D game where you catapult egg warriors from one planet to
another to conquer them. Then I decided it was just cool to make a skateboarding game with ragdolls, because why not?
I finally made a very short attempt in making a 2D game with boats fighting each other in a big storm. But I'm just
really bad at 2D graphics — did you know how hard it is to make good pixel/2D art? Hats off to all the 2D artists.

My main issue was my inability, as a solo developer, to create good art. I can easily imagine a scene and the art direction, but my lack of artistic skills to produce what I had in mind always frustrated me to the utmost. Of course you can blockout and use generic game assets. But at some point you need to see it and integrate your art with your game
mechanics. You know that with no money, all you can do is to learn it by yourself.

I had to make all these attempts to discover that my style is voxel art! Conclusion? Failures are experimentations.

### Creating worlds with Voxel Art

### Integration and game builds

### Developing a community

## Making games is not always fun

### You can't go fulltime

### You have to keep going

### Sleep debt overflow

## Pursue your dreams, go make games
