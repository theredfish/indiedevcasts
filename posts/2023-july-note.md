Hey indie fellows how are you? Time flies and I don't want to be inactive for too long. You
deserve news so here's a quick note for July 2023.

## Starting a new job

If you recall in my post, [Agenda 2023: What's next for Indiedevcasts](https://indiedevcasts.com/posts/agenda-2023-whats-next-indiedevcasts),
I was talking about new things in my life, including a new SDET job. So it's official, I started and
it took me some time to finish some of my projects, adapt to my new job and close my business as a
freelancer. In the meantime, I decided to open source everything from [Owl Duty](https://owlduty.com)
as I didn't get the expected results. But it's ok, I learned a lot on the development side and met
incredible people ðŸ¤©.

I will continue open source development for Owl Duty but at a very different pace. I will now balance
my time between writing, game development, voxel art, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@indiedevcasts) videos, family, home enovations and my day job! Yeah, said like that it doesn't seem possible but
I'm sure I will find a way. I need to be really organized.

## My next goals

- Publish more blog posts, not only technical articles but also personal notes and devlogs
- Develop the Indiedevcasts community
- Learn enough about shaders to create biomes in my game: water, ground, fog, ...
- Improve the website: navigation, sections, ...
- Develop the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@indiedevcasts) channel

The last point is difficult to be honest. Recording and editing videos takes so much time. It will be
easier once I have something visual to show with Pirate Annihilation.

## Let's connect?

I only invest time on YouTube and Twitter. So if you have the blue bird app, you can [follow me](https://twitter.com/indiedevcasts). I will be happy to talk about gamedev or random stuff!
