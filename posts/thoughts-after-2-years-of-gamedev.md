1. Quick intro about the current project, what I'm doing
2. Finding your own style and workflow
    2.b Take the time to fail
    2.a How I found my own style with voxel art
    2.c Create early builds (why => a step towards quality builds, pipeline to automate, try on different systems, demos, alpha, ... does it work?)
3. Think big then cut the fat
    3.a You shouldn't restrain yourself (ideas, let the flow, go to try, go gamedev => you should be passionate about )
    3.b The compound effect (you will have a shit ton of dead projects, but also a shit ton of experience, systems, ...)
    3.c The summer body of your next project
4. Making games is not always fun
    4.a You can't go fulltime
    4.b You have to keep going
    4.c A sleep debt "this big"
5. Pursue your dreams, go make games

## Finding your own style and workflow
